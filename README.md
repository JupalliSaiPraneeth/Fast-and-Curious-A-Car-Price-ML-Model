# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning analysis aimed at predicting car prices based on various features from a structured dataset. The project walks through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic modeling using `scikit-learn`.

## Dataset
The dataset used is **CarPrice_Assignment.csv**, which contains information about car features such as engine size, horsepower, brand, and price.

## Whatâ€™s inside:
- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature Engineering
- Basic Predictive Modeling (Regression)
- Evaluation of model performance

## Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib & seaborn
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
